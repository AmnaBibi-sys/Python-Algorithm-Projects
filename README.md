# 📊 Algorithm Visualization Suite

An interactive and educational tool built with **Python** and **Tkinter** to visualize complex algorithms in real-time. This suite helps students and developers understand the step-by-step logic behind sorting, matrix operations, and graph algorithms.

## ✨ Features
* **Linear Sorting:** Visualizations for Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
* **Matrix Multiplication:** Interactive step-by-step Standard and Strassen’s algorithm demonstrations.
* **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Real-time graph generation using Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
* **Heap Sort:** Unique dual-view visualization showing both Array and Binary Tree structures.
* **Interactive Controls:** Adjust speed, array size, and input data manually.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI Library:** Tkinter
* **Process Management:** Subprocess (for launching individual projects)
